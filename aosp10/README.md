## Preface
The device needs to have the Docker environment installed in advance.

## Getting Started
All you need to do is execute the following commands:
> chmod +x run.sh
> 
> ./run.sh

This will create a Docker image named aosp10, which can be viewed by running:
> sudo docker image ls -a

By doing this, you will have obtained a source package and build environment for aosp10-r1. All that's left is to download the corresponding driver files and carry out the compilation.
